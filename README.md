# Next Steps
The purpose of this readme is to address any future design decisions or feature that we believe should be worked on in the next iteration of this project.

## Connection between watches and web app
A pivotal feature that will prove to be a strong asset to the project is implementing a method in which both smartwatches can automatically send the retrieved PPG data directly to the web application. Since the ML models have been completed, there is already functionality to read this data and determine a patient's diagnosis.
