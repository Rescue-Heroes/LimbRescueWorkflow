### LimbRescueML

### LimbRescueWeb
- Develop a user friendly web application that allows patients/doctors to create an account, upload data, and identify a diagnois. 
- The web application will facilitate a home based monitoring protocol for patients to monitor and track their lymphedema recordings.
- The web application has been built using the Django framework and is styled using CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. 
- The webapplication also features a chat bot within the 'Help' page in order for patients to recieve automated assistance to answer any questions regarding the project.
### LimbRescueWorkflow
- Our team has drafted this wonderful repo that you are currently accessing. :)
- The purpose of this workflow is to keep a running list of features and design decisions that have been implemented over the various iterations of this project.
- Each team should take it upon themselves to update this README as they add new features to the project in order to maintain an organized workflow for future teams and sponsors to access. 
- Keeping this README organized will ensure a more productive and less confusing development cycle of the project for each team's iteration.

# Next Steps
The purpose of this readme is to address any future design decisions or feature that we believe should be worked on in the next iteration of this project.

## Connection between watches and web app
A pivotal feature that will prove to be a strong asset to the project is implementing a method in which both smartwatches can automatically send the retrieved PPG data directly to the web application. Since the ML models have been completed, there is already functionality to read this data and determine a patient's diagnosis.
